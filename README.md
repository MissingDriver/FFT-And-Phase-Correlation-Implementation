# FFT-And-Phase-Correlation-Implementation
Just a simple prograam written in python that tracks a black circle using my phase correlation. The is also meant as an exercise, as its my first attempt at writing a fft algorithm. The 2d fft is derived from two 1d ffts. Similarly the inverse fft is done in the same manner. The fft is bassed off of the Cooley-Tukey method.
